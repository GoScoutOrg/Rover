*from measurments we can see that the average spread is about 2398 encoder ticks.
the minumum is 2339 for these twenty calibrations and the max is 2445.
most of the data variation is from the four encoders having slightly different
amounts of spread.

Conclusion: if the spread is between 2300 and 2500 it probably calibrated correctly.
